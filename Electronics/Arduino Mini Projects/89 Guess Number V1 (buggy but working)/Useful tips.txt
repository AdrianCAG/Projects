* Copy Servo_Alignment code indo Arduino IDE and attach servo pin to pin 9.


Servo_Alignment is designed to help visually align the servo with the number scale used in the game.
The servo starts at 100 and gradually moves:
- To 50 in 8 seconds
- Then to 0 in another 8 seconds
- After reaching 0, it resets and the cycle repeats.

To improve accuracy, attach a plastic pin or pointer to the top of the servo horn.
Try to align it as precisely as possible with the number markers to visually represent the current value.

Continuously reads temperature from the DHT11 sensor, and compares it to the threshold value.
Turns the relay ON and lights the LED if temperature exceeds threshold + hysteresis.
Turns them OFF when temperature falls below threshold - hysteresis.
LCD displays both current and target (threshold) temperature.

Slider is used for Set Mode and Monitor Mode. 
LOW (slide OFF) = Set Mode     - Slide to the left 
HIGH (slide ON) = Monitor Mode - Slide to the right

In Set mode: use 3 digit-select buttons (Hundreds: pin 8, Tens: pin 9, Ones: pin 10) to choose which 
digit to modify. Rotate the encoder to increase or decrease the selected digit. Then slide
to the right to save the new threshold temperature to EEPROM. Also display shows the new threshold while 
editing.



Notes
-----
- Threshold is stored in EEPROM, so it’s saved even if power is lost.
- Hysteresis (±0.25 °C) prevents frequent relay switching.
- You can adjust the hysteresis value in code if needed.


* Add anything you want to relay module.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hysteresis refers to a phenomenon where the output of a system depends not only on the current input but 
also on the past history of inputs. In simpler terms, it's a lagging response where the output does not 
immediately match the change in input, and the system's state depends on how it reached the current input. 
This lag can be observed in various systems, from physics and engineering to economics and even biology.

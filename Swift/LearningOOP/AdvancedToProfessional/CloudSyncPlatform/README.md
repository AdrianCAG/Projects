# CloudSyncPlatform

A professional-level Swift application demonstrating advanced architecture and multiple design patterns for a cloud synchronization platform.

## Overview

CloudSyncPlatform is a sophisticated cloud synchronization and storage system that allows users to securely store, sync, and share files across multiple devices. It demonstrates advanced Swift programming concepts and implements multiple design patterns in a cohesive, production-ready architecture.

## Design Patterns Implemented

1. **MVVM Architecture** - Separation of UI, business logic, and data
2. **Repository Pattern** - Abstraction of data sources
3. **Factory Method Pattern** - For creating different types of sync strategies
4. **Strategy Pattern** - For different synchronization algorithms
5. **Observer Pattern** - For real-time updates and notifications
6. **Dependency Injection** - For loose coupling and testability
7. **Decorator Pattern** - For adding features to file operations
8. **Adapter Pattern** - For integrating with different cloud providers
9. **Singleton Pattern** - For shared resources like configuration
10. **Command Pattern** - For encapsulating file operations

## Key Features

- Secure file storage with encryption
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Bandwidth-efficient delta synchronization
- Background synchronization
- Offline capabilities
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- User authentication and access control
- File sharing and collaboration
- Reactive programming with RxSwift
- Local persistence with Realm

## Technical Stack

- Swift 5.5+
- RxSwift for reactive programming
- Alamofire for networking
- RealmSwift for local persistence
- Swift Crypto for encryption
- Swift Log for logging
- Rainbow for console UI
- SwiftyJSON for JSON handling

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Swift 5.5+ installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `swift build` to build the project
4. Run `swift run` to start the application

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture approach with the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer** - UI and ViewModels
- **Domain Layer** - Use cases and business logic
- **Data Layer** - Repositories and data sources
- **Infrastructure Layer** - Networking, storage, and platform services

Each layer is isolated with clear boundaries, making the codebase maintainable and testable.
